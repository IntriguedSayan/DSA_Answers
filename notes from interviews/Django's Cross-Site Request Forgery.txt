Django's Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is implemented as a middleware that checks each incoming POST request for the presence of a CSRF token. This token is typically rendered in forms as a hidden field. When the form is submitted, the middleware checks if the token in the form matches the token stored in the user's session. It's essential because it prevents attackers from tricking a user into performing unwanted actions on a website where they're authenticated.
